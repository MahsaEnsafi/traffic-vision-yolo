Object Detection using Pretrained YOLO and Traffic Vision Training

This repository demonstrates two key stages in object detection:
1. Testing a pretrained YOLO model for general object detection.
2. Training the YOLO model specifically for traffic vision tasks, optimizing it to detect and classify traffic-related objects.


Dataset
This project uses the Traffic Signs Detection from Kaggle.
